# Bam Roadmap

Placeholder for a basic roadmap.

This project will need to be built in stages. Existing tools and libraries (LLVM, GCC, etc) will need to be leveraged before having a complete native `bam` compiler toolchain. Until this point, anyone wanting to compile `bam` programs will have to have these extra tools installed.

This document will outline a plan for the project stages.
